# Data, Role, and Site Mapping

Lets discuss the flow of data in your organization, data management processes, roles, and sites. All of this is essential for us to understand how to structure the system, resources needed and to do some troubleshooting if needed.​

Each organization already has an existing information collection and management process. Even without an official system in place, organizations use methods to make sense of their work, to create summary reports for and to be able to create for internal program and financial management purposes, donor reporting, sharing statistics with a coordination body or government, or for advocacy efforts. Methods can include tracking a set of monthly activities or indicators that staff then calculate across the program – in paper or electronic form; with a calculator or by hand; transferred by vehicle, email, on foot, or with a telephone call. These methods may be systematic and happen regularly, or they may depend on the situation and specific information needs. ​

It can be highly beneficial when starting to implement the GBVIMS or when your program structure or coordination responsibilities change to conduct an information management mapping exercise, sometimes called data mapping. This is a constructive first step in designing the flow of a functional information system and will help in later planning. ​

Previously, we went over an overview of the system, now let’s look at the system more closely.​

To use GBVIMS+ the rollout will need to be endorsed by the GBVIMS Steering Committee.  Once that happens and the criteria and resources required are met, then the system will be set up by a system administrator.  That administrator will provide log-in information for users to access the system.  

Roles are created to determine what actions someone with that title can perform in the system.  ​

Each user must have a role, but not all roles must be assigned to a user.  Some may sit in the system for future use.

Roles include: Organizational focal point, case workers, program coordinators, mobile case workers and case management supervisors.

**Organizational focal point:** they can access all records. They have permissions to read, import, export \(xls and JSON for IR\) and flag cases and incidents. They can refer and transfer \(cases only\) and assign cases. They can read and write exports. They can also read all roles, as well as read, write and create users.

**Case workers:** they can only access their own records \(cases and incidents\). They have permissions to read, write, and flag cases and incidents. They can refer and transfer \(cases only\). They can request approval for action plans and case closure.

**Program coordinators:** they can access all records but not individual level data. They can read incident number, type of violence, date and location of incident. They can read and write reports.

**Mobile case workers:** they can only access their own records \(cases and incidents\). They have permissions to read, write, create, and flag cases and incidents. They can refer and transfer \(cases only\). They can request approval for action plans and case closure. They can also synchronize cases to the mobile application.

**Case management supervisors:** they can only access records of users in their user group \(cases and incidents\). They cannot see any identifying information on cases or incidents. They have permissions to read, import, export JSON and flag cases and incidents. They can refer and transfer \(cases only\) and assign cases. They can request approve/reject action plans and case closure. They can also generate a custom export.
